# üìä The Tech Journal  

**Analysis of Major Tech Companies' Employment and Performance in the Aftermath of COVID and the Rise of AI**  

---

## üìå Overview  
This project delivers an **interactive Tableau dashboard** analyzing employment patterns and financial outcomes across leading tech firms. The focus is on:  
- H-1B visa approvals/denials (2023‚Äì2024)  
- Layoffs and workforce changes post-COVID  
- Stock price fluctuations and investor sentiment  
- Company-specific case studies (e.g., Meta Platforms Inc.)  

By integrating these aspects, the dashboard reveals how **human capital decisions** (layoffs, immigration outcomes, talent acquisition) directly shape **stock valuation and market behavior**.

## üìà Dashboards  

There are **three main dashboards**, each covering a key dimension of the project:  

1. **Layoff Dashboard**  
   - Visualizes the connection between **layoffs** and **market value trends**.  
   - Helps understand how workforce reductions influence investor confidence and stock prices over time.  

2. **Visa Effect Dashboard**  
   - Presents **H-1B visa petition approvals/denials** across Apple, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Netflix, NVIDIA, and Salesforce.  
   - Links visa outcomes with **workforce scale** and **stock behavior**.  

3. **Meta Journal Dashboard**  
   - A **case study on Meta Platforms Inc.**  
   - Shows how layoffs, visa outcomes, and workforce changes impact **stock performance** over time.  
   - Reveals that while Meta‚Äôs valuation rose, the **rate of growth slowed** as denials increased.  

‚ú® **Together, these dashboards portray** the interplay between workforce dynamics, immigration policies, and investor sentiment in the tech sector.

- Layoffs can temporarily boost stock by signaling cost-cutting, but repeated rounds reduce impact.  
- Increased **H-1B denials** align with dips in stock growth, showing investor sensitivity to workforce constraints.  
- Salesforce and NVIDIA stand out for high approval ratios, tying skilled foreign talent strategy to performance stability.  
- Workforce and immigration data act as **leading indicators** of organizational and financial health.
